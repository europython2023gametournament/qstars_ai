# strategy

## base

- build 2 mines
- build 1 tank
- build extra mine
- build 2 jets
- build boat
- build 2 tanks

maintain army, then increase all gradually, beginning with mines

then repeat

- build extra mine
- build jet
- build boat
- build jet
- build boat

## vehicle behaviour

- jets fly in circles
  - whheeeeeeeeeeee (ie: fire and forget)
- tanks guard the base
  - first one stays at base, circles around, attacks enemies if seen
    - this should defend the base
  - later: station them in a circle around the base, with smaller scan circles
  - if defeated, build replacement
- boat example behaviour is fine

## todo: get clever with attacking and detecting
